Hometernet is a commercial real-estate app built using python, kivy and pyrebase.

I had to squish all of my python files into a single main.py file because my computer couldn't handle more modules being opened in VSCode.

Tools:

Python
Kivy
KivyMD
Pyrebase (Python framework for firebase)
Buildozer (for compiling the app into an APK)

Kivy and KivyMD are used for the UI, and Python is used for the main backend with Pyrebase being used for authentication.

The app can be compiled using google colab or github with a buildozer.spec file which determines the specifications of the mobile app.
